The 3 recent months of shipment are not included, as the calculation allows for 90 days beyond the 12 months of shipments to attach services, in order to maximize the attach rate. The 15/12 attach rate is a rolling metric, which means that every time you look at it, you are looking at prior 15 months that align with a given month.</p><p><b>Example</b>-  Let’s imagine that we want to inspect the 15/12 attach rate for July FY17. To do that, we need to look at products shipped from May FY16 through April FY 17. The service booking for this timeframe can occur anytime during the 15 month period between May FY16 through July FY17.

The 3 recent months of shipment are not included, as the calculation allows for 90 days beyond the 12 months of shipments to attach services, in order to maximize the attach rate. The 15/12 attach rate is a rolling metric, which means that every time you look at it, you are looking at prior 15 months that align with a given month.</p><p><b>Example:</b>  Let’s imagine that we want to inspect the 15/12 attach rate for July FY17. To do that, we need to look at products shipped from May FY16 through April FY 17.  The service booking for this timeframe can occur anytime during the 15 month period between May FY16 through July FY17.  The last 3-month period (May, June and July of FY 17) provides extra time to attach services for products shipped between May FY17 and April FY17.</p>", "<p>This is a quarterly view of product shipped and new services attached within a specific quarter.  The green/red triangles compares the quarter with the previous years quarter.  Green means it's increased and red means it's decreased.</p>", "<p>This graph illustrates the Attach rate by month and compare it with the different, selectable nodes.</p>"],
